This repo includes a brief internal report for a short analysis of daily
temperature records from >100 stations. The data is "melted" and then
I tried a 3-window moving average to smooth it.

The code for time series analysis in this notebook was re-adapted, modified,
and/or expanded from Jason Brownlee's amazing blog, and can be checked out at:

_"Disclaimer"_: Data for this notebook is proprietary, so I cannot share or show
full descriptions of it.
