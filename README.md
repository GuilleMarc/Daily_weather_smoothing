This repo includes a brief internal report for a short analysis of daily
temperature records from >100 stations. The data is "melted" to a long format
for ease of analysis, and then smoothed through a 3-window moving average.

The code for time series analysis in this notebook was re-adapted, modified,
and/or expanded where possible from Jason Brownlee's amazing blog, and can be checked out at:

_"Disclaimer"_: Data for this notebook is proprietary, so I cannot share or
describe it in detail. A few entries are shown in the notebook for reference
